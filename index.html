      <p>We sincerely apologize for short notice given for shutting down Kitestring. </p>
      <p>We understand that you were dependent on the service and the sudden closure has affected you. For this, we are truly sorry.</p>
        <p>As you have experienced recently we have had a lot of maintenance issues with Kitestring due to it being built on an old, legacy system.</p>
          <p>Due to this and the complexities of maintaining this system the senior management at Travelwifi has made the decision to close Kitestring.</p>
        <p>We appreciate you being a customer with us and we are sad that we cannot continue to provide this service.
